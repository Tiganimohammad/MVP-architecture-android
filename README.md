What is Android MVP?

Model :- Model manage data components that provide functionality like fetch, store, sort, and expose data.

Voew :- View manage user interface actions.

Presenter :- Presenter works as an intermediator between View and Model. Presenter accept event from View, analyse action, get required data from Model and send data back to View for update UI.

Why do we need MVP or any structure?

While working with any long-term project, it needs to be scalable, less complicated. MVP makes it possible by dividing code structure into three different layers (MODEL – PRESENTER – VIEW).
